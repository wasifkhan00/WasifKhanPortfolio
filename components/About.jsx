          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            I specialize in building mobile responsive front-end UI applications
            that connect with API’s and other backend technologies. I’m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building front-end applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.

            I started my self-taught web developement jounrey in 2020, I had
            started web development as a fun. Subsequently, my interest for it
            got broader and I started loving to work with forms data & would
            always be curious to connect the server and the frontend. Due to
            that I decided not to focus only on the frontend but the backend as
            well. So for the backend I learned and worked with AWS and after
            working with AWS it made me more interested in the backend, cloud
            computing and I started digging it deeply.
